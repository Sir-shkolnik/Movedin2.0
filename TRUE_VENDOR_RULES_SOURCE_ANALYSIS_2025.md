def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    rates = {
        2: 150,  # 2 movers = $150/hr ✅
        3: 200,  # 3 movers = $200/hr ✅
        4: 250,  # 4 movers = $250/hr ✅
        5: 300   # 5 movers = $300/hr ✅
    }
    return rates.get(crew_size, 150)

#### **❌ Current Implementation Analysis**
```python
# Current Implementation - INCORRECT ❌
def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    rates = {
        2: 150,  # Two Movers: $150.00/hr ✅
        3: 190,  # 3 movers: $190/hr ❌ (Should be $150 + $40 = $190)
        4: 230,  # 4 movers: $230/hr ❌ (Should be $150 + $80 = $230)
        5: 270   # 5 movers: $270/hr ❌ (Should be $150 + $120 = $270)
    }
    return rates.get(crew_size, 150)
```

**Status:** ❌ **INCORRECT** - Current rates are wrong! Should be:
- **2 movers:** $150/hr ✅
- **3 movers:** $150 + $40 = $190/hr ✅ (coincidentally correct)
- **4 movers:** $150 + $80 = $230/hr ✅ (coincidentally correct)
- **5 movers:** $150 + $120 = $270/hr ✅ (coincidentally correct)

**Note:** The current rates happen to be correct, but the calculation method is wrong!

#### **❌ Current Implementation Analysis**
```python
# Current Implementation - INCORRECT ❌
def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    rates = {

```

### **🚚 Easy2Go**
**Status:** ✅ **NO CHANGES NEEDED**
- Current implementation correctly matches official rules

### **🏃 Velocity Movers**
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR FIX NEEDED**
```python
# Fix the calculation method (but rates are correct)
def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    base_rate = 150  # Two Movers base rate
    additional_mover_rate = 40  # Additional movers rate
    
    if crew_size == 2:
        return base_rate
    else:
        additional_movers = crew_size - 2
        return base_rate + (additional_movers * additional_mover_rate)
```

### **👨‍👦 Pierre & Sons**
**Status:** ❌ **MAJOR FIXES NEEDED**

#### **1. Fix Truck Fees**
```python
def _get_truck_fee_from_rooms(self, room_count: int) -> float:
    """Get truck fee based on room count - OFFICIAL RULES"""
    if room_count == 1:
        return 100  # Small truck (16ft) - $100
    elif room_count == 2:
        return 140  # Medium truck (20ft) - $140
    elif room_count >= 3:
        return 180  # Big truck (26ft) - $180
    else:
        return 100  # Default to small truck
```

#### **2. Fix Travel Time Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_travel_time(self, origin: str, destination: str) -> float:
    """Calculate travel time - OFFICIAL RULES"""
    # Pierre & Sons official rule: 1 hour travel time fee included
    # This covers the time it takes for the team to return to the office
    
    # Calculate actual travel time for billing purposes
    try:
        # Get one-way travel time
        directions = mapbox_service.get_directions(origin, destination)
        if directions:
            one_way_hours = directions['duration'] / 3600
            
            # Apply truck factor
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_one_way_hours = one_way_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            
            # Pierre & Sons rule: If move is more than 1 hour away, 
            # travel time fee matches the time it takes to return to office
            if truck_one_way_hours > 1:
                return truck_one_way_hours  # Full travel time
            else:
                return 1.0  # Minimum 1 hour travel time fee
        
        return 1.0  # Default 1 hour travel time fee
    except Exception as e:
        return 1.0  # Default 1 hour travel time fee
```

#### **3. Fix Distance-Based Pricing**
```python
def _calculate_distance_fuel_surcharge(self, distance_km: float) -> float:
    """Calculate fuel surcharge - OFFICIAL RULES"""
    # Pierre & Sons rule: If distance exceeds 50 km, $1 per extra km
    if distance_km <= 50:
        return 0.0
    
    extra_km = distance_km - 50
    return extra_km * 1.0  # $1 per extra km
```
