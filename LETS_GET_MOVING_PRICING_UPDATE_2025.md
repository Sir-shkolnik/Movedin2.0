## 🎯 **BUSINESS IMPACT ACHIEVED**

### **✅ Old Model (Dock to Dock) - ELIMINATED:**
```
❌ Count everything: office departure → office return
❌ Time = 15 min + 120 min + 120 min + 120 min + 120 min = 8.0 hrs
❌ 8.0 hrs × $149 = $1,192.00 + Fuel Fee $260 = $1452.00
```

### **✅ New Model (Travel Time + Job Time) - ACTIVE:**
```
✅ Travel Distance (extended local):
✅ Office → Origin = 0.37h, Destination → Office = 0.87h
✅ Total travel time = 1.24h (1.5 hours flat rate)
✅ 1.5 × $199.0 × 1 truck = $298.50

✅ Job Time:
✅ Loading + Drive Origin → Destination + Unloading
✅ 5.5 hrs + 1.01 hrs = 6.51 hrs
✅ 6.51 × $199.0 = $1,196.83

✅ Grand Total = $298.50 + $1,196.83 = $1,495.33 (before markup)
```
