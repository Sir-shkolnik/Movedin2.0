    def send_vendor_notification(self, lead_data, vendor_email, lead_id, payment_intent_id)
```

### **2. Integration Points**

# Send vendor notification with payment intent
await send_vendor_email(req.lead_data, vendor.email, lead_id, req.payment_intent_id)

# Send payment notification to support
support_success = email_service.send_payment_notification_to_support(req.lead_data, lead_id, req.payment_intent_id)
```

### **3. Configuration (`backend/app/core/config.py`)**
```python
# Email Configuration
