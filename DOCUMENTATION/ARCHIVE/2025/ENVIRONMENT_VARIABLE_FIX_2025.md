# 🔧 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FIX - MovedIn 2.0**

**Generated:** August 2, 2025  
**Issue Type:** Environment Variable Causing Mixed Content Errors  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**System Version:** 2.4.0

## 📊 **ISSUE SUMMARY**

After fixing the localhost URLs and API utility, the admin panel was still experiencing mixed content errors due to an environment variable `VITE_API_URL` that was set to `http://localhost:8000`. This was causing the frontend to make HTTP requests instead of HTTPS requests to the backend.

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**

### **✅ Console Errors Detected:**
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://movedin-frontend.onrender.com/#/admin' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://movedin-backend.onrender.com/api/leads'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Error loading dashboard stats: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Error loading leads: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

### **✅ Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Environment Variable:** `frontend/.env` had `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
2. **API Utility:** `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` was using this environment variable
3. **Quote Generation:** `Step4.tsx` was using the API utility for quote generation
4. **Compiled Code:** The build process was including the HTTP URL in the compiled JavaScript

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ 1. Environment Variable Fix**
**File:** `frontend/.env`
**Line:** 2
**Change:** Updated API URL to use HTTPS
```bash
# Before
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# After
VITE_API_URL=https://movedin-backend.onrender.com
```

### **✅ 2. Frontend Rebuild**
**Process:** Rebuilt the frontend with updated environment variable
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### **✅ 3. Git Force Add**
**Process:** Force added the environment file to git (was ignored)
```bash
git add -f frontend/.env
git commit -m "🔧 Fix environment variable for production API URL - Update VITE_API_URL to use HTTPS backend"
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**

### **✅ Git Workflow:**
1. **Identified Issue:** Found environment variable causing HTTP requests
2. **Applied Fix:** Updated VITE_API_URL to use HTTPS
3. **Rebuilt Frontend:** Generated new build with correct URLs
4. **Committed Changes:** Git commit with descriptive message
5. **Pushed to GitHub:** Triggered Render auto-deployment
