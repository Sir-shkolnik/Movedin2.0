# 🔧 **DOCKER BUILD CONTEXT FIXED**

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

### **🔍 Problem Identified**
The Docker build was failing because:
- **Error**: `COPY requirements.txt .` - file not found
- **Cause**: Build context was set to repo root, but `requirements.txt` is in `backend/` folder
- **Solution**: Set build context to `backend/` folder in `render.yaml`

### **🔧 Fix Applied**
Added to `render.yaml`:
```yaml
build:
  context: backend
```

This tells Render to:
- Use `backend/` folder as the Docker build context
- Find `requirements.txt` in the correct location
- Build the Docker image properly

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **✅ Changes Applied**
- **Repository**: Updated with build context fix
- **No app changes**: Your MovedIn app structure unchanged
- **Docker build**: Should now succeed

### **🔄 Next Steps**
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
2. **Click "Manual Deploy"** on the backend service
3. **Monitor the build logs**
4. **Should see successful build**

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **✅ Build Should Succeed**
- **No more**: "requirements.txt not found" error
- **Docker build**: Completes successfully
- **Backend service**: Deploys and becomes live

### **✅ All Services Working**
- **Database**: ✅ PostgreSQL running
- **Redis**: ✅ Key Value cache running
- **Backend**: 🔄 Should deploy successfully now
- **Frontend**: ✅ Static site working

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

After successful deployment:
- **Backend Health**: `https://movedin-backend.onrender.com/health` returns healthy
- **API Docs**: `https://movedin-backend.onrender.com/docs` accessible
- **Lead Data**: Being saved to database
- **Admin Panel**: `https://movedin-frontend.onrender.com/admin` working

**🎯 GO TO RENDER DASHBOARD AND CLICK "MANUAL DEPLOY" ON THE BACKEND SERVICE!**

**The Docker build should now succeed and your backend will be live!** 🚀
