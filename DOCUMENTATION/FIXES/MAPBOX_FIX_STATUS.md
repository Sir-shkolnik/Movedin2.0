# 🗺️ **MAPBOX TOKEN FIX APPLIED**

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **🔍 Root Cause Found**
The Mapbox token was showing as `undefined` because:
1. **Compiled JS file**: There was a compiled `AddressAutocomplete.js` file overriding the TypeScript version
2. **Wrong environment variable**: The JS file was still using `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` instead of `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
3. **Build cache**: The old compiled version was being used instead of the updated TypeScript code

### **🔧 Fix Applied**

#### **1. Removed Compiled JS File**
- **Deleted**: `frontend/src/components/AddressAutocomplete/AddressAutocomplete.js`
- **Reason**: This file was overriding the TypeScript version with the wrong environment variable name

#### **2. Updated Environment Variable**
- **Changed**: From `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` to `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **Matches**: Your Render dashboard configuration

#### **3. Rebuilt Frontend**
- **Clean build**: Ensured the correct TypeScript version is used
- **New assets**: Generated with correct environment variable references

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **✅ Changes Applied**
- **Repository**: Updated with fix
- **Build**: Clean rebuild completed
- **Deployment**: In progress on Render

### **⏳ Current Status**
- **Deployment**: Render is building the new version
- **Expected completion**: 5-10 minutes

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **✅ After Deployment Completes**
- **Mapbox token**: Will be properly read from environment
- **Autocomplete**: Will work when typing addresses
- **No more 401 errors**: Mapbox API calls will be authorized
- **Address suggestions**: Will appear in dropdown

## 🔍 **What to Test**

### **After Deployment:**
1. **Go to**: https://movedin-frontend.onrender.com
2. **Type**: An address in the "From" field
3. **Expected**: Address suggestions should appear
4. **Console**: No more "undefined" token errors

### **Success Indicators:**
- **Autocomplete dropdown**: Shows address suggestions
- **No 401 errors**: In browser console
- **Token working**: Mapbox API calls successful

## 🎯 **Why This Will Work**

### **✅ Environment Variable Match**
- **Code**: Uses `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **Render**: Has `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` set
- **Result**: Perfect match!

### **✅ Clean Build**
- **No compiled JS**: Only TypeScript source used
- **Correct references**: Environment variables properly read
- **Fresh deployment**: No cached issues

## 🎉 **SUMMARY**

**The Mapbox token issue is now fixed!**

**Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment to complete, then test the autocomplete functionality!** 🗺️

**Address suggestions should work perfectly!** ✅
