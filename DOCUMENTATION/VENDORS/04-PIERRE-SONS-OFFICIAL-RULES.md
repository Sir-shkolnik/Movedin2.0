        return 140  # Medium truck (20ft) - $140
    elif room_count >= 3:

        directions = mapbox_service.get_directions(origin, destination)
        if directions:
            one_way_hours = directions['duration'] / 3600
            
            # Apply truck factor
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_one_way_hours = one_way_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            
            # Pierre & Sons rule: If move is more than 1 hour away, 
            # travel time fee matches the time it takes to return to office
            if truck_one_way_hours > 1:
