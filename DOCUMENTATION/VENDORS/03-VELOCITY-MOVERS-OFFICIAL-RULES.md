The current Velocity Movers implementation in `backend/app/services/vendors/velocity_movers_calculator.py` correctly matches the official rules.

#### **Hourly Rate Calculation**
```python
def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    """Get hourly rate based on crew size - OFFICIAL VELOCITY MOVERS RULES"""
    # Official Velocity Movers rule: "Two Movers $150.00 | Additional Movers $40.00"
    base_rate = 150  # Two Movers base rate
    additional_mover_rate = 40  # Additional movers rate
    
    if crew_size == 2:
        return base_rate
    else:
        additional_movers = crew_size - 2
        return base_rate + (additional_movers * additional_mover_rate)
```

#### **Crew Size Calculation**
```python
def _get_crew_size_from_weight(self, weight: float) -> int:
    """Get crew size from weight using official weight table"""
    # Velocity Movers weight table from official data
    weight_table = [
        [500, 1000, 2], [1000, 2000, 2], [2000, 3000, 2], [3000, 4000, 3],
        [4000, 5000, 3], [5000, 6000, 3], [6000, 7000, 3], [7000, 8000, 3],

        [12000, 13000, 5], [13000, 14000, 5], [14000, 15000, 5]
    ]
    
    for min_weight, max_weight, crew_size in weight_table:
        if min_weight <= weight <= max_weight:
            return crew_size
    
    return 5  # Default for very heavy moves
```

#### **Truck Count Calculation**
```python
def _get_truck_count_from_weight(self, weight: float) -> int:
    """Get truck count from weight using official weight table"""
    # Velocity Movers weight table from official data
    weight_table = [
        [500, 1000, 1], [1000, 2000, 1], [2000, 3000, 1], [3000, 4000, 1],
        [4000, 5000, 1], [5000, 6000, 1], [6000, 7000, 1], [7000, 8000, 1],
        [8000, 9000, 1], [9000, 10000, 1], [10000, 11000, 2], [11000, 12000, 2],
        [12000, 13000, 2], [13000, 14000, 2], [14000, 15000, 2]
    ]
    
    for min_weight, max_weight, truck_count in weight_table:
        if min_weight <= weight <= max_weight:
            return truck_count
    
    return 2  # Default for very heavy moves
```

#### **Travel Time Calculation**

    """Calculate travel time - OFFICIAL VELOCITY MOVERS RULES"""
    try:
        dispatcher_address = "100 Howden Road, Unit 2, Toronto, ON M1R 3E4"

            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
