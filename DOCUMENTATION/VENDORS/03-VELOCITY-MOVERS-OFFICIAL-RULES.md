## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Current Implementation Status: ‚úÖ CORRECT**

The current Velocity Movers implementation in `backend/app/services/vendor_engine.py` correctly matches the official rules.

#### **Crew Size Calculation**
```python
def get_crew_size(self, quote_request: QuoteRequest) -> int:
    """Crew size based on room count - OFFICIAL VELOCITY MOVERS RULES"""
    # Official Velocity Movers crew sizing based on room count
    if quote_request.total_rooms <= 2:
        return 2
    elif quote_request.total_rooms <= 3:
        return 3
    elif quote_request.total_rooms <= 4:
        return 4
    else:
        return 5
```

#### **Hourly Rate Calculation**
```python
def _get_hourly_rate(self, crew_size: int) -> float:
    """Get hourly rate based on crew size - OFFICIAL VELOCITY MOVERS RULES"""
    # Official Velocity Movers rule: "Two Movers $150.00 | Additional Movers $40.00"
    base_rate = 150  # Two Movers base rate
    additional_mover_rate = 40  # Additional movers rate
    
    if crew_size == 2:
        return base_rate
    else:
        additional_movers = crew_size - 2
        return base_rate + (additional_movers * additional_mover_rate)
```

#### **Travel Time Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_travel_time(self, origin: str, destination: str) -> float:
    """Calculate travel time using 3-leg journey to depot"""
    try:
        dispatcher_address = "100 Howden Road, Unit 2, M1R 3E4, Toronto, ON"
        
        # Calculate 3-leg journey: Dispatcher -> Origin -> Destination -> Dispatcher
        leg1 = mapbox_service.get_directions(dispatcher_address, origin)
        leg2 = mapbox_service.get_directions(origin, destination)
        leg3 = mapbox_service.get_directions(destination, dispatcher_address)
        
        total_duration = 0
        legs_with_data = 0
        
        for leg in [leg1, leg2, leg3]:
            if leg and 'duration' in leg:
                total_duration += leg['duration']
                legs_with_data += 1
        
        if legs_with_data > 0:
            car_travel_hours = total_duration / 3600
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_travel_hours = car_travel_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            return truck_travel_hours
        
        # Fallback calculation
        origin_to_dest = mapbox_service.get_directions(origin, destination)
        if origin_to_dest and 'duration' in origin_to_dest:
            one_way_hours = origin_to_dest['duration'] / 3600
            car_three_leg_hours = one_way_hours * 2.5
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_three_leg_hours = car_three_leg_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            return truck_three_leg_hours
        
        return 2.0 * 1.3
    except Exception as e:
        return 2.0 * 1.3
```
