    try:

        for leg in [leg1, leg2, leg3]:
            if leg and 'duration' in leg:
                total_duration += leg['duration']
                legs_with_data += 1
        
        if legs_with_data > 0:
            car_travel_hours = total_duration / 3600
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_travel_hours = car_travel_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            return truck_travel_hours
        
        # Fallback calculation

            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
