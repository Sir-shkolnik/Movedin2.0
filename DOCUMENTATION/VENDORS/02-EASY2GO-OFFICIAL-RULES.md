        for leg in [leg1, leg2, leg3]:
            if leg and 'duration' in leg:
                total_duration += leg['duration']

            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
            truck_travel_hours = car_travel_hours * TRUCK_FACTOR
            return truck_travel_hours
        
        # Fallback calculation
        origin_to_dest = mapbox_service.get_directions(origin, destination)
        if origin_to_dest and 'duration' in origin_to_dest:
            one_way_hours = origin_to_dest['duration'] / 3600
            car_three_leg_hours = one_way_hours * 2.5
            TRUCK_FACTOR = 1.3
