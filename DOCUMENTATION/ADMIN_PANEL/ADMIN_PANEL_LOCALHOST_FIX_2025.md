**Generated:** August 2, 2025  
**Issue Type:** Admin Panel CORS Errors  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 📊 **ISSUE SUMMARY**

After the successful backup, the admin panel was experiencing CORS errors due to remaining `localhost:8000` URLs in several admin components. These components were still trying to connect to the local development server instead of the production backend.

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**

### **✅ Console Errors Detected:**

Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/leads/' from origin 'https://movedin-frontend.onrender.com' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
