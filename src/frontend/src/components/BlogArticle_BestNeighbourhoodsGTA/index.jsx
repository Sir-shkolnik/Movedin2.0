              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>1. Research Schools Early</h3>
                <p>
                  Start researching schools 6-8 months before your move. Visit schools, talk to other parents, and check Fraser Institute rankings. Many top GTA schools have waitlists for specialty programs like French Immersion.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>2. Visit Neighbourhoods Multiple Times</h3>
                <p>
                  Visit your potential neighbourhood at different times - weekday mornings (school drop-off), afternoons (pickup time), and weekends. This gives you a true feel for traffic, noise levels, and community activity.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>3. Consider Commute Times Realistically</h3>
                <p>
                  Use Google Maps during actual rush hour times to gauge real commutes. GO Train schedules vary - check both peak and off-peak times. Factor in parking costs at GO stations.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>4. Book Movers 6-8 Weeks Ahead</h3>
                <p>
                  GTA family moves, especially during summer and month-end, require advance booking. Get quotes from multiple companies and confirm they're licensed and insured.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>5. Check Building/Condo Moving Rules</h3>
                <p>
                  If moving into a condo or townhouse complex, check moving regulations early. Many require elevator bookings, insurance certificates, and deposits. Some restrict moving to specific days/times.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="tip-card">
                <h3>6. Plan for Parking Permits</h3>
                <p>
                  Most GTA municipalities require parking permits for moving trucks. Apply 2-3 weeks in advance to avoid delays and fines on moving day.

            <h2>ü§î How to Choose the Right Neighbourhood for YOUR Family</h2>
            
            <p>Every family is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. Here's how to narrow down your choice:</p>
            
            <div className="decision-guide">
              <div className="decision-factor">
                <h3>Prioritize Your Must-Haves</h3>
                <p>
                  Create a list of your top 5 non-negotiables. Is it school quality? Commute time? Home size? Budget? Parks and recreation? Knowing your priorities helps eliminate options quickly.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="decision-factor">
                <h3>Involve Your Children</h3>
                <p>
                  If your children are old enough, involve them in the decision. Let them research schools, visit parks, and express their preferences. A move is easier when everyone feels heard.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="decision-factor">
                <h3>Test the Commute</h3>
                <p>
                  Actually do the commute during rush hour. What seems reasonable on paper can feel exhausting daily. Consider both driving and GO Train options.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="decision-factor">
                <h3>Calculate Total Costs</h3>
                <p>
                  Beyond house prices, consider property taxes, GO Train passes, parking costs, and recreational program fees. Some "cheaper" areas have higher taxes and commuting costs.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="decision-factor">
                <h3>Talk to Current Residents</h3>
                <p>
                  Join local Facebook groups, visit community centers, and chat with parents at parks. Real residents provide insights you won't find in official statistics.
