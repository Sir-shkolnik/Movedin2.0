        Moving stress refers to the emotional strain caused by relocating from one place to another. Even if it&apos;s a happy occasion, the change makes us feel overwhelmed, fearful, and uncertain

        The pressure of packing and unpacking, uncertainty of new surroundings, and fear of the unknown are just a few reasons moving might stress us out. We may also be leaving behind familiar
        people, places, and routines. Thankfully, with the right mindset and approach, moving stress can be managed, allowing one to embrace the opportunities and adventures that lie ahead.
