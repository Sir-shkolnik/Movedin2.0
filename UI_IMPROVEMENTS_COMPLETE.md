# UI Improvements Complete

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ **Removed Purple "Step 1 of 7" Badge**

**File:** `src/frontend/src/components/quote-wizard/WizardContainer.jsx`

**What was removed:**
- The purple pill-shaped badge showing "Step 1 of 7" that was fixed at the top-right
- Lines 123-138 (the Progress Text div)

**Why:**
- User feedback indicated this badge looked bad and was unnecessary
- The progress bar at the top already shows visual progress
- The step indicators below show which step is active

**Result:**
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Progress still visible via the 4px progress bar at the top
- Step indicators show current position

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/src/components/HeroSection/index.jsx`
- `src/frontend/src/components/HeroSection/style.css`
- Image copied to: `src/frontend/public/moving-truck-illustration.png`

**Changes:**

#### A. **Added Image Element**
```jsx
<div className="hero-illustration">
  <img 
    src="/moving-truck-illustration.png" 
    alt="Moving truck with boxes illustration" 
    className="hero-image"
  />
</div>
```

#### B. **Updated Hero Section Layout**
- Changed from single column to **two-column flex layout**
- Text content on the **left** (max-width: 600px)
- Illustration on the **right** (max-width: 480px)
- Gap between columns: 48px

#### C. **Responsive Behavior**

**Result:**

#### B. **Enabled Text Wrapping**
- Changed from `white-space: nowrap` to `white-space: normal`
- Added 2-line max with `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`
- Proper word breaking with `overflow-wrap: break-word`

#### C. **Better Spacing**
- Small phones: 3px gap
- Large phones: 4px gap
- Tablets: 6px gap
- Added `min-width` to each step item for consistency

#### D. **Improved Alignment**
- Changed from `justify-content: center` to `flex-start`
- Better scrolling behavior on mobile
- Increased bottom padding for vertical breathing room
- All icons properly centered

**Result:**
- All text labels now fully visible
