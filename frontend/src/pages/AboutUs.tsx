                  <p>
                    Our founder, a busy professional moving across Toronto, spent weeks calling moving companies, 
                    getting inconsistent quotes, and worrying about hidden fees. The industry was broken ‚Äì 
                    opaque pricing, unreliable movers, and endless phone calls.

                  <h3>The Vision</h3>
                  <p>
                    We envisioned a platform where Canadians could get instant, transparent quotes from 
                    pre-vetted, licensed movers in minutes ‚Äì not weeks. A place where moving became 
                    simple, reliable, and stress-free.

                  <h3>MovedIn is Born</h3>
                  <p>
                    Built by moving industry veterans and technology experts, MovedIn launched with a 
                    simple mission: to make moving as easy as ordering takeout. Our first month saw 
                    50 successful moves, and we knew we were onto something special.

                    from apartments to mansions, from local moves to cross-country relocations.
