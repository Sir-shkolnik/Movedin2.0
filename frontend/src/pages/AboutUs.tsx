              <p className="mission-text">
                At MovedIn, we're revolutionizing the Canadian moving industry by creating a transparent, 
                efficient, and customer-first platform that connects Canadians with verified, licensed, 
                and insured moving companies. Our mission is to eliminate the stress, uncertainty, and 
                hidden costs that have traditionally plagued the moving experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                We envision a future where moving is simple, transparent, and enjoyable - where every 
                Canadian can access professional moving services with confidence, knowing they're working 
                with trusted partners who prioritize their belongings and satisfaction.

              <h2>Our Story: From Frustration to Innovation</h2>
              <p>
                MovedIn was born in 2024 from a simple yet powerful frustration: the traditional moving 
                industry was complex, opaque, and often frustrating for customers. Canadians were spending 
                countless hours calling multiple moving companies, waiting for callbacks, dealing with 
                inconsistent pricing, and worrying about the reliability of their chosen movers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founders, having experienced these challenges firsthand, decided to change the game. 
                They assembled a team of moving industry experts, technology professionals, and customer 
                service specialists to create a platform that would put customers first, every time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to serve thousands of Canadians across the country, from major urban 
                centers like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal to smaller communities throughout Canada. 
                Our platform has facilitated successful moves for families, businesses, and individuals, 
                helping them find reliable movers at fair prices with complete transparency.
