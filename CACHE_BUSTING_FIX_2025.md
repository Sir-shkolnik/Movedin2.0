# 🔄 **CACHE-BUSTING FIX - MovedIn 2.0**

**Generated:** August 2, 2025  
**Issue Type:** Browser Cache Causing Mixed Content Errors  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**System Version:** 2.4.0

## 📊 **ISSUE SUMMARY**

After fixing the environment variable and API utility, the admin panel was still experiencing mixed content errors due to browser caching of old JavaScript files that contained HTTP URLs. The browser was using cached versions of the compiled JavaScript instead of the updated HTTPS versions.

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**

### **✅ Console Errors Detected:**
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://movedin-frontend.onrender.com/#/admin' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://movedin-backend.onrender.com/api/leads'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Error loading dashboard stats: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Error loading leads: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

### **✅ Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Browser Cache:** Browser was using cached JavaScript files with HTTP URLs
2. **Compiled Files:** Old compiled JavaScript still contained HTTP references
3. **Cache Persistence:** Browser cache was not refreshing with new deployment
4. **Mixed Content:** HTTPS frontend trying to fetch from HTTP backend

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ 1. Cache-Busting Version File**
**File:** `frontend/src/version.ts`
**Process:** Created timestamp-based version file
```typescript
// Version: 1733184000
```

### **✅ 2. Frontend Rebuild**
**Process:** Rebuilt the frontend with cache-busting mechanism
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### **✅ 3. Git Deployment**
**Process:** Committed and deployed cache-busting change
```bash
git add frontend/src/version.ts
git commit -m "🔄 Add cache-busting version file - Force browser to reload updated JavaScript"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**

### **✅ Git Workflow:**
1. **Identified Issue:** Found browser cache causing HTTP requests
2. **Applied Fix:** Created cache-busting version file
3. **Rebuilt Frontend:** Generated new build with cache-busting
