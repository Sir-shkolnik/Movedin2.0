# Mobile Step Indicators Update

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Changes Made

### Issue
The mobile responsive quote form had step indicators with large gaps between icons, making them look disorganized and taking up too much horizontal space.

### Solution
Updated the CSS for mobile step indicators across all breakpoints to make them more compact and organized.

## CSS Changes in `src/frontend/src/components/quote-wizard/style.css`

### 1. **Large Phones (480px - 768px)**
- **Gap between icons**: Reduced from `6px` to `2px`
- **Icon size**: Reduced from `44px` to `40px`
- **Icon SVG size**: Reduced from `24px` to `20px`
- **Title width**: Reduced from `80px` to `65px`
- **Title font size**: Reduced from `11px` to `10px`
- **Added**: `justify-content: center` to center icons
- **Added**: `pointer-events: none` to prevent manual clicking
- **Added**: Text overflow handling (ellipsis)

### 2. **Small Phones (< 480px)**
- **Gap between icons**: Reduced from `4px` to `1px`
- **Icon size**: Reduced from `40px` to `36px`
- **Icon SVG size**: Reduced from `18px` to `16px`
- **Title width**: Reduced to `55px`
- **Title font size**: Reduced to `9px`
- **Added**: `justify-content: center` to center icons
- **Added**: `pointer-events: none` to prevent manual clicking

### 3. **Tablets (768px - 1024px)**
- **Gap between icons**: Reduced from `6px` to `3px`
- **Title width**: Set to `68px`
- **Title font size**: Set to `10px`
- **Added**: `justify-content: center` to center icons
- **Added**: `pointer-events: none` to prevent manual clicking
- **Added**: Text overflow handling (ellipsis)

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Tighter Spacing**
Icons are now much closer together, creating a more compact and organized navigation bar.

### ✅ **Better Fit**
Icons and labels are properly sized to fit mobile screens without unnecessary white space.

### ✅ **Controlled Navigation**
Added `pointer-events: none` ensures icons cannot be manually clicked - they only update based on the form's current step (controlled by the form navigation logic).

### ✅ **Responsive Text**
Text labels now have proper overflow handling with ellipsis, preventing text from breaking the layout.

### ✅ **Centered Layout**
Icons are centered horizontally, creating a balanced appearance.

## Behavior

- **Icons are read-only**: Users cannot click on them to navigate
- **Auto-progression**: Icons highlight automatically based on form progression
- **Current step indication**: Active step is visually distinct with purple highlight
- **Scroll support**: On very small screens, icons can scroll horizontally if needed
