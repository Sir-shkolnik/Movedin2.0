# 🔧 **ADMIN PANEL API URL FIX - MovedIn 2.0**

**Generated:** August 2, 2025  
**Fix Type:** API URL Trailing Slash Issue  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**  
**System Version:** 2.4.0

## 📊 **ISSUE SUMMARY**

The admin panel was experiencing "Failed to fetch" errors for the Leads API, which was preventing the dashboard from loading lead data properly. This was caused by a URL mismatch between the frontend calls and backend route definitions.

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **✅ Problem Identified:**
- **Frontend Calls:** `/api/leads/` (with trailing slash)
- **Backend Route:** `/api/leads` (without trailing slash)
- **Result:** HTTP 307 redirect to HTTP instead of HTTPS, causing mixed content errors

### **✅ Technical Details:**
```bash
# Frontend was calling:
https://movedin-backend.onrender.com/api/leads/

# Backend route was defined as:
@router.get("/leads", response_model=List[LeadResponse])

# This resulted in:
HTTP/2 307 
location: http://movedin-backend.onrender.com/api/leads
```

### **✅ Impact:**
- **Admin Dashboard:** Could not load lead statistics
- **Lead Management:** Could not display lead data
- **System Monitoring:** Shows "Failed to fetch" error
- **User Experience:** Incomplete admin panel functionality
