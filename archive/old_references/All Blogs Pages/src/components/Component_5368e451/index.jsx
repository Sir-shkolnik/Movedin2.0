              Chances are you&apos;ve got stuff that you don&apos;t want to take with you. Go through your closets and storage to decide what to toss or donate. You might even want to have a yard

              Packing materials like boxes, bubble wrap, and tape can be purchased from any moving or storage company. You might also check with your local grocery store or LCBO to collect boxes. LCBO
              boxes are perfect for heavy items like books.
