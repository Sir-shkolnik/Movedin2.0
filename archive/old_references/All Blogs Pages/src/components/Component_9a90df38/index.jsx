        Moving in Toronto can be tricky. Almost every neighbourhood is densely packed with housing. Traffic is rarely good, parking is at a premium, and depending on the time of year you&apos;re
        moving, the most direct routes across the city might be under construction. You won&apos;t have the luxury of time on either end, which is why it&apos;s vital to have a well-thought-out plan
        going in.
