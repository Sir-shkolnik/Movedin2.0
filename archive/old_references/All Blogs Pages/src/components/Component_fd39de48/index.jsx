        Moving day is here! In a perfect world, your mover will arrive on time, and you&apos;ll be ready for them to work their magic. If you can&apos;t be there, enlist someone you trust to liaise
        with the movers and oversee the process. They should stay until the movers are gone.

        No matter how prepared you are, unexpected issues may arise. Be prepared, have an overnight bag with all your essentials, and make arrangements to stay elsewhere in case things take longer
        than expected. Having a trusted friend with you may help you to stay calm under pressure. If delays occur, speak to your moving company right away as they may be able to help.
