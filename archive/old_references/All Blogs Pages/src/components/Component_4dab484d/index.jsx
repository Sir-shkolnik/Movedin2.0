          <li>Protect inside floors from tracking ice and melting snow. Putting down cardboard or drop cloths are both excellent strategies.</li>
          <li>Ensure the moving truck is as close to the door as possible to shorten the transport distance.</li>
          <li>Use an assembly-line approach where people hand off boxes to the next person and then onto the truck.</li>
          <li>Wrap electronics, computers, and TVs with sheets and blankets. To minimize damage, consider moving these items in a regular car (not a moving van).</li>
          <li>
            Organize your boxes with heavy and oversized stuff in the front of the truck. Your essential items, lighter items, and more fragile boxes should go on the vehicle last and be first off.
          </li>
          <li>Once you arrive at your destination, unload as quickly as possible.</li>
          <li>
            Protect floors and carpets with waterproof protectors, and be sure they don&apos;t become slick with melted snow and ice. Salt can stain floors and carpets, so do your best to lay down
            tarps or other protection before movers start to move through the place.
