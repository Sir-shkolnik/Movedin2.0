              Not everyone has the time or wherewithal to move themselves. However, depending on how much stuff you need to move, you might choose to do it yourself. If you need to use a mover, think
              about how much stuff you have before you call around. Movers charge based on weight but may give you an estimate according to how many rooms you&apos;re moving.

              Shop around for the best rates, but do your due diligence. If a company charges much less than other movers, it might be a red flag. Choose a reputable company with good reviews and an
              established reputation.
