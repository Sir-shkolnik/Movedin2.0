              Utilities require notice to change over. Sometimes, if you&apos;re using the same provider at the new address, it&apos;s as simple as making a call and arranging to transfer your
              account. However, in cases where you&apos;re changing providers, you may need to give significant notice. Some utilities require 60 days advance notice to close your account, so
              don&apos;t leave this until the last minute.
