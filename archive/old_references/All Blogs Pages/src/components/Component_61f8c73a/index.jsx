        Winter moves are never fun. Okay, let&apos;s face itâ€”moving is no picnic at any time of the year, but a winter move in Toronto has its own place in infamy as something literally no one wants
        to do.
      </p>
      <p className="p-style-51f1e624">
        First of all, there&apos;s the weather. Winters in Toronto are unpredictable, so no matter how well you plan, Mother Nature might throw you a curveball. A big dump of snow or an ice storm can
        not only wreak havoc on traffic, but parking might be even more of an issue, and keeping your boxes and valuables off the ground and safe from moisture will be even more challenging.
      </p>
      <p className="p-style-51f1e624">
        The best strategy is to plan for the worst possible scenario. Then, you&apos;ll be prepared no matter what. Plus, if the pavement is dry and the going is good, your winter move will be
        practically balmy!
