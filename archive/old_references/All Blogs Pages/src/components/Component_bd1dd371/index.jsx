        Since it&apos;s Toronto winter in all its glory, be prepared to spend a lot of time indoors once you&apos;re moved in. You might experience service delays for things like cable and internet
        hookups or new furniture deliveries, so be prepared to roll with it if necessary.
      </p>
      <p className="p-style-d91d0eac">
        The best advice we can provide is to arrange your service calls well in advance of your move and confirm all appointments ahead of time. Prepare well, but expect delays.
