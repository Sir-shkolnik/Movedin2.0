        Once you grasp the concept of mindfulness, it&apos;s easy to implement it into your daily life. Anytime you feel stressed or your mind starts to race, pull your attention to what&apos;s going
        on with your body. Take inventory of each body part and how it feels at that moment. Notice your breath, how cool the air is when you breathe in, how warm it is when you breathe out.Â
