# Vendor Calculator System - Fixes Applied

## ✅ **All Critical Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **Long-Distance Move Rejection** ✅
**Problem:** System was calculating quotes for moves >10 hours one-way  
**Fix:** All vendors now reject moves exceeding 10 hours one-way travel time

**Implementation:**
- Added `MAX_TRAVEL_TIME_HOURS = 10.0` constant
- All vendors check one-way travel time before calculating
- Returns rejection message: "This is a long-distance move (X hours one-way). We don't handle moves over 10 hours."
- Frontend displays "Not Available" with red warning message

**Affected Vendors:**
- ✅ Let's Get Moving
- ✅ Pierre & Sons
- ✅ Velocity Movers
- ✅ Easy2Go

---

### 2. **Closest Dispatcher Selection** ✅
**Problem:** All vendors using "Toronto, ON" as dispatcher for all moves  
**Fix:** System now finds closest dispatcher based on origin address

**Implementation:**
- Added `findClosestDispatcher()` function in validation.js
- Uses distance calculation to find nearest dispatcher
- 18 dispatcher locations across Canada:
  - Toronto, Mississauga, Markham (Ontario)
  - Vancouver, Burnaby (British Columbia)
  - Calgary, Edmonton (Alberta)
  - Montreal, Montreal North (Quebec)
  - Ottawa, Hamilton, London, Windsor (Ontario)
  - Winnipeg (Manitoba)
  - Halifax (Nova Scotia)
  - Fredericton (New Brunswick)
  - Regina (Saskatchewan)

**Example:**
- Vancouver move → Uses Vancouver dispatcher (not Toronto!)
- Calgary move → Uses Calgary dispatcher (not Toronto!)
- Montreal move → Uses Montreal dispatcher (not Toronto!)

**Result:** Accurate travel time calculations for all provinces

---

### 3. **Minimum 2 Hours Labor Time** ✅
**Problem:** Some quotes showing <2 hours labor  
**Fix:** All vendors enforce minimum 2 hours labor time

**Implementation:**
- `MINIMUM_LABOR_HOURS = 2.0` constant
- Applied in `calculateTotalLaborHours()` function
- `Math.max(MINIMUM_LABOR_HOURS, calculatedHours)`

**Result:** All quotes show minimum 2 hours labor time

---

### 4. **Large House Logic** ✅
**Problem:** Large houses (6+ bedrooms) causing issues  
**Fix:** Proper crew and truck calculation for large moves

**Implementation:**
- **Let's Get Moving:**
  - 7+ rooms → 5 movers
  - 5-6 rooms → 4 movers
  - 4 rooms → 3 movers
  - <4 rooms → 2 movers
  - 5+ movers OR 6+ rooms → 2 trucks
  - 4+ movers OR 5+ rooms → 2 trucks
  - Otherwise → 1 truck

- **Pierre & Sons:**
  - 5+ rooms → 5 movers
  - 4 rooms → 4 movers
  - 3 rooms → 3 movers
  - ≤2 rooms → 2 movers
  - 4+ movers → 2 trucks
  - ≤3 movers → 1 truck

- **Velocity Movers:**
  - Same crew logic as Pierre & Sons
  - Hourly rate: $150 for 2 movers + $40 per additional mover

- **Easy2Go:**
  - Weight-based crew calculation
  - 5+ movers → 2 trucks
  - ≤4 movers → 1 truck

**Result:** Proper crew/truck allocation for all house sizes

---

### 5. **Hourly Rate Clarity** ✅
**Problem:** Unclear how hourly rates are calculated  
**Fix:** Clear documentation and logging of hourly rate calculations

**Implementation:**

#### **Let's Get Moving:**
- Base rate from location (mock data for now)
- 1 Truck:
  - 2 movers: `base_rate` (e.g., $169)
  - 3 movers: `base_rate + $60` (e.g., $229)
  - 4 movers: `base_rate + $140` (e.g., $309)
- 2 Trucks:
  - 4 movers: `2 × base_rate + $20`
  - 5 movers: `2 × base_rate + $80`
  - 6 movers: `2 × base_rate + $140`

#### **Pierre & Sons:**
- Fixed rates by crew size:
  - 1 mover: $65/hr
  - 2 movers: $135/hr
  - 3 movers: $165/hr
  - 4 movers: $195/hr
  - 5 movers: $225/hr
  - 6 movers: $255/hr

#### **Velocity Movers:**
- Base: $150 for 2 movers
- Additional: +$40 per mover
- 2 movers: $150/hr
- 3 movers: $190/hr
- 4 movers: $230/hr
- 5 movers: $270/hr

#### **Easy2Go:**
- Fixed rates by crew size:
  - 2 movers: $140/hr
  - 3 movers: $180/hr
  - 4 movers: $220/hr
  - 5 movers: $260/hr

**Result:** Clear, transparent hourly rate calculations

---

### 6. **Frontend Display for Rejected Quotes** ✅
**Problem:** Long-distance moves showing invalid quotes  
**Fix:** Frontend displays "Not Available" with rejection message

**Implementation:**
- Checks for `is_long_distance` or `total_cost === 0`
- Displays grayed-out card with red warning
- Shows rejection reason to user
- Cannot select unavailable vendors

**Result:** Clear user feedback for unavailable services
