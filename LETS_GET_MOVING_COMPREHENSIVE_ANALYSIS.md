---

## 🔍 **CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **✅ What We Have Implemented:**

#### **1. Dynamic Calendar-Based Pricing**
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Real-time pricing data from dispatcher calendars
- **Date-Based Rates**: Different rates for different dates (peak/off-peak)
- **Location-Specific Pricing**: Each dispatcher has unique rates
- **Availability Checking**: 366-day forward search for available dates

#### **2. Crew Size Logic (TRUE LGM RULES)**
```python
# Official LGM crew logic from old app data:
if room_count >= 7: return 5    # 5+ movers for very large homes
elif room_count >= 5: return 4  # 4 movers for 5-6 bedroom homes  
elif room_count >= 4: return 3  # 3 movers for 4 bedroom homes
else: return 2                  # 2 movers for smaller homes

# Heavy items auto-upgrade crew to at least 3
if heavy_items_count > 0: return max(base_crew, 3)
```

#### **3. Truck Count Logic (TRUE LGM RULES)**
```python
# Official LGM truck logic from old app data:
if crew_size >= 5 or room_count >= 6: return 2  # 2 trucks
elif crew_size >= 4 or room_count >= 5: return 2  # 2 trucks  
else: return 1  # 1 truck for smaller moves
```

#### **4. Hourly Rate Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_hourly_rate(self, base_rate: float, crew_size: int, truck_count: int) -> float:
    if truck_count == 1:
        if crew_size == 2: return base_rate
        elif crew_size == 3: return base_rate + 60
        elif crew_size == 4: return base_rate + 140
        else: return base_rate + 200
    else:  # 2 trucks
        if crew_size == 4: return 2 * base_rate + 20
        elif crew_size == 5: return 2 * base_rate + 80
        else: return 2 * base_rate + 100
```

#### **5. Labor Hours Estimation**
```python
# Room-based labor hours with crew efficiency:
labor_hours_map = {
    1: 3.5, 2: 4.5, 3: 5.5, 4: 6.5, 5: 7.5, 6: 8.5, 7: 9.5
}

# Crew efficiency adjustments:
if crew_size == 4: labor_hours -= 1.0    # 4 crew is more efficient
elif crew_size == 3: labor_hours -= 0.5  # 3 crew is slightly more efficient
labor_hours = max(labor_hours, 2.0)      # Minimum 2 hours
```

#### **6. Travel Time Calculation (3-Leg Journey)**
- **Leg 1**: Dispatcher → Origin
- **Leg 2**: Origin → Destination (job time)
- **Leg 3**: Destination → Dispatcher
- **Total Travel**: Leg 1 + Leg 3 (Leg 2 is job time, not travel)
- **Mapbox Integration**: Real-time directions and traffic data

#### **7. Fuel Charge Table (TRUE LGM RATES)**
```python
fuel_charge_table = [
    [1.75, 2.75, 260],   # 1:45–2:45 Hours, $260
    [2.75, 3.75, 450],   # 2:45–3:45 Hours, $450
    [3.75, 4.75, 580],   # 3:45–4:45 Hours, $580
    [4.75, 5.75, 710],   # 4:45–5:45 Hours, $710
    [5.75, 6.75, 840],   # 5:45–6:45 Hours, $840
    [6.75, 7.75, 970],   # 6:45–7:45 Hours, $970
    [7.75, 8.75, 1100],  # 7:45–8:45 Hours, $1,100
    [8.75, 9.75, 1230],  # 8:45–9:45 Hours, $1,230
    [9.75, 10.75, 1360]  # 9:45–10:75 Hours, $1,360
]
```

#### **8. Heavy Items Pricing**
```python
rates = {
    "piano": 250,    # Piano moving
    "safe": 300,     # Safe moving  
    "treadmill": 100 # Treadmill moving
}
```

#### **9. Additional Services (Currently $0)**
- **Packing**: $110 (requires vendor assessment)
- **Storage**: $200 (requires vendor assessment)
- **Cleaning**: $396 (requires vendor assessment)
- **Junk Removal**: $150 (requires vendor assessment)

## ✅ System Verified (September 11, 2025)

- Calculator logic: verified (crew/truck/hourly/fuel/heavy items)
- Google Sheets calendar integration: verified (base rate fetch by date/location)
- Travel calculation (3-leg): verified with Mapbox v6
- Note: LGM may be filtered out of `/api/generate` results for specific routes/dates due to availability/enablement; calculator itself is functioning as designed.
